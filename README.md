## Overview

This application facilitates classroom discussions about AI ethics in three steps:

1. **Scenario Submission**: Students submit AI use cases across the ethical spectrum (clearly ethical, clearly unethical, and borderline cases)
2. **Voting**: Students rate scenarios on a 1-5 scale (1 = unethical, 5 = ethical)
3. **Results Visualization**: Real-time aggregation and visualization of class voting patterns. The class can discuss the results.
